# Loyalty+

This repository contains a minimal full-stack skeleton for the Loyalty+ application.

## Backend

The backend is an Express.js server with PostgreSQL. It supports user registration, login, and a protected profile route using JWT authentication.

### Setup

```bash
cd backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm start
```

## Frontend

The frontend is a simple React app using Vite and TailwindCSS with a basic login form.

### Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

This minimal skeleton can be expanded to implement the full Loyalty+ feature set.
